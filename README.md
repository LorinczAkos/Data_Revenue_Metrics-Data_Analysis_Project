Hi All! This project contains all my acquired knowledge with the duration of the course with GoIT Romania Data Analysis.

Below you can find the result of the SQL scripts translated into several dashboards.

My aim was to respect the Data Analysis rules for Dashboard presentation.

Within the dashboard I strived to show information in a way that is easy to understand for those even outside of Data Analysis or even the project itself
as I believe a good analyst needs to create a bridge of information that is not overwhelming and clicks fast for the user that at what values are they looking at.

The location of the filters were intentionally set to the middle at 'eyes level' I would say so in case of modifying anything they can see the changes in real time,
therefore have a visual feedback that the data represented indeed has updated itself therefore they can trust it.
